# Buddy Scanner #

**Buddy Scanner** is a mobile App that uses the face.com API for detection and analysis of faces.

**Buddy Scanner** is licensed under the **GNU GPL v2**, tested on Android, but the code is build on top of cordova/phonegap and thus should be easily portable to other platforms.

# Important update #

_face.com has been acquired by facebook and the developers API is discontinued. The app will therefore not work anymore. I will keep the code online for educational purposes._
