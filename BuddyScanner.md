# Introduction #

**Buddy Scanner** is a mobile face-detection App that uses face.com's APIs.

# Important update #

_face.com has been acquired by facebook and the developers API is discontinued. The app will therefore not work anymore. I will keep the code online for educational purposes._

# Details #

**Buddy Scanner** is build using:

  * [PhoneGap/Cordova](http://phonegap.com/)
  * [jQuery mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/)
  * [jQuery zoomooz plugin](http://janne.aukia.com/zoomooz/)

The app uses:
  * [face.com's API](http://face.com)

Currently tested on Android, but it should be easily portable to other devices (iphone, blackberry, windows phone).

  * on Android, camera images are not rotated according to phone orientation

# Participate #

If you want to participate, feel free to get in contact. Brogrammers needed. Also designers, good ideas, and people who just like to do projects. Open source FTW!

If check out the files in the repository, remember to sign up on face.com and update the credentials in the file /assets/www/config.js.

# Privacy #

**Buddy Scanner** uploads the images _directly_ to face.com (using an unencrypted http connection). And, yes, as always, you should be concerned about privacy. Feel free to post your concerns and suggestions in the comments.

# Personal #

The project is a weekend thing. A humble technological counterpart to a garage band. So sometimes the code is a bit of a mess, sorry for that. But there are so many things to do in life that are nicer than cleaning up code.
